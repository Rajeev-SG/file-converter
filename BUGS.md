- Some browsers may report incorrect file sizes for files larger than 2GB
- File size calculation might be affected by system-specific file attributes

### Warnings
- Large file handling may cause performance issues in the preview generation
- Memory usage increases with the number of large files being previewed simultaneously

## File Preview System

### Known Issues
1. **PDF Preview**

2. **Text Files**
   - Text files show only first 128 characters
   - Some text encodings may not display correctly
   - No syntax highlighting for code files
   - Preview container size fixed, may truncate content

3. **Performance**
   - Multiple large files may cause UI lag
   - PDF processing can be CPU intensive

## File Conversion System

### Critical Issues
1. PDF Conversion Limitations
   - **Issue**: PDF to other format conversions not yet implemented
   - **Impact**: Users cannot convert from PDF to markdown or HTML
   - **Status**: To be implemented
   - **Workaround**: None currently available

2. HTML to Markdown Conversion
   - **Issue**: Basic text extraction only, formatting not preserved
   - **Impact**: Loss of HTML structure and styling in markdown output
   - **Status**: In progress
   - **Workaround**: Manual formatting after conversion

### Warnings
1. HTML to PDF Conversion
   - **Issue**: Complex HTML layouts may not render correctly
   - **Impact**: PDF output might not match HTML layout exactly
   - **Status**: Needs improvement
   - **Workaround**: Use simpler HTML structures for better results

2. Large File Handling
   - **Issue**: Memory usage spikes with large files
   - **Impact**: Potential performance issues with files over 10MB
   - **Status**: Monitoring
   - **Workaround**: Split large files before conversion

## File Conversion Issues

### PDF Conversion
1. **PDF Generation Failure**
   - Status: Critical
   - Issue: Cannot convert files to PDF format due to character encoding issues
   - Error: "WinAnsi cannot encode \"â”œ\" (0x251c)"
   - Affects: HTML to PDF and Markdown to PDF conversions
   - Root Cause: Character encoding incompatibility in PDF generation library
   - Workaround: Currently no workaround available
